//! `ag.docket-issuance:v1` — authenticated issuance for an exact Docket
//! prepared attempt.
//!
//! **Status.** This module is the historical standalone conformance/example
//! producer. Its [`IssuanceDecisionLedger`] is caller-owned and in-memory, so
//! it is not the canonical production occurrence authority. Production uses
//! `CampaignEngineV1` and `CampaignStoreV1` through the governed C1 loop. This
//! module remains exported for wire compatibility and retained fixtures.
//!
//! Docket prepares an exact attempt and projects it as a
//! `gwr:authz-request:v1` request. This module evaluates that request through
//! AG's existing decision path and, for an admitted decision only, emits one
//! immutable authenticated issuance record.
//!
//! **What crosses the boundary.** An issuance record is an *authenticated
//! immutable fact about a decision*. It is not authority: `Authority<F>`
//! remains non-serializable and stays inside this process, exactly as
//! `crates/ag-kernel` requires. Nothing here can reconstruct it, and the
//! record deliberately carries no capability, no secret, no Docket standing,
//! and no execution or admissibility verdict. Docket mints its own local
//! single-use standing after verifying this record; that standing is Docket's,
//! not ours.
//!
//! **Authenticity** reuses the repository's existing Ed25519 stack (ring
//! Ed25519, PKCS#8 v2 credentials, canonical base64url encodings,
//! domain-separated signature prefixes over strict canonical JSON) with one
//! new prefix for this statement kind. No new cryptography, no shared secret.
//!
//! **The decision token is sealed.** [`DocketDecision`] has private fields and
//! no public constructor, so it can only come from
//! [`DocketIssuanceOffice::decide`]. A caller cannot fabricate one and reach
//! [`DocketIssuanceOffice::issue`] with the catalog, actor, scope, effect-class,
//! and principal-chain checks skipped.
//!
//! **Dual canonical domains.** The request's exact bytes are hashed two ways
//! and both travel: `raw_sha256` (plain SHA-256 over the exact transported
//! bytes, the domain Docket also computes) and `ag_canonical_digest` (this
//! repository's domain-separated digest). Neither is recomputed from the
//! other, and neither is presented as interchangeable with the other, nor
//! with Docket's own prepared-attempt transcript digest, which we echo but
//! never recompute.
