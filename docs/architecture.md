# AG-ng implementation contract

Status: **earlier daemon line**. The `agd`, `ag-effectd`, `ag-providerd`, and
`agctl` services described here are the earlier daemon line packaged by
`debian/`. They are not the surface qualified in the 0.1.0-alpha.6 composed
profile, which used `ag-loopctl` and `ag-operator-ui`; those are not packaged.
See the [main-branch guide](public-guide.md) for the current path.

## Constitutional boundary

`agd` may judge but may not mutate governed targets. `ag-providerd` may hold
machine inference credentials and bounded provider-access capability, usage,
dispatch/custody, lifecycle, and revocation state, but it owns no
governed-effect authority and cannot authorize AG effects. `ag-effectd` may
execute only a closed, broker-compiled effect vocabulary and has no network,
planner, model, plugin, shell, or arbitrary-command surface.

The network-capable provider implementation is a separate Cargo package from
the `ag-app` package that produces `ag-effectd`. Release builds must run
`scripts/verify-effectd-isolation.sh`; it rejects provider HTTP/TLS crates in
the broker's dependency closure and checks the resulting artifact for injected
provider-network code.

Only `CanonicalEffectProposalV1` bytes compiled and persisted by `ag-effectd`
may be ratified. `agd` submits `ProposalIntentV1` plus already-admitted artifact
references; its projections are never ratification inputs.

## Authority Governor and latent judgment seam

AG-ng's governing interpretation is a stateful **Authority Governor**, not a
general agent framework. AG owns authority domains and epochs, principal
lineage and independence, standing and scope, ratification, delegation and
revocation, durable one-use authority spend, closed effect execution,
uncertain-outcome custody, fresh reconciliation, and managed-pointer
activation and promotion. Worker, provider, transport, CLI, and packaging code
are bounded adapters around that authority system; they do not move planning,
conversation, prompting, semantic memory, retrieval, runtime tool discovery,
plugin loading, model orchestration, or generalized multi-agent orchestration
into AG.

A future transport-independent judgment-carriage substrate might carry
versioned source and target judgment identities, subjects and scopes,
provenance, typed refusals and operationally indeterminate outcomes, bridge
descriptors, explicit non-implications, and digest-bound decision or receipt
envelopes. It must not own authority, testimony, policy standing, bridge
licensing, institutional independence, execution, or revocation. Testimony
cannot deserialize or cast into authority, authority cannot manufacture
testimonial sufficiency, and AG retains fresh local observations where an
authority spend is vulnerable to current-state drift.

This seam is an architectural constraint, not a roadmap commitment. Extraction
must wait until a concrete second implementation requires the same executable
judgment-carriage semantics and demonstrates that the common surface is not
merely AG-shaped.

Current v1 has bounded transport debt. `BrokerSubmissionRecordV1` retains a
`GovernedProposalIngressV1`, including signed-local-RPC challenge and request
objects; worker candidate source proofs retain equivalent dynamic RPC evidence;
and human ratification and reconciliation records bind fields named
`signed_request`. These bindings preserve the authenticated principal and exact
request evidence required by current custody, but their wire representation is
not an authority semantic. This campaign does not migrate those persisted
schemas. A future second transport must terminate its wire objects at an
adapter boundary and supply equivalent authenticated-principal and
exact-request evidence without changing authority semantics.

## Target v1 surface

- Bounded, noninteractive proposal-workspace sessions.
- Strict Unix-socket protocols and content-addressed artifact ingestion.
- Exact human ratification and bounded host-effect mandates.
- Git managed-ref compare-and-swap promotion.
- Managed regular-file create, replace, and quarantined delete.
- Closed systemd unit actions over D-Bus.
- Durable burn-before-effect and reconciliation without automatic retry.

The current executable vertical slices are exact human ratification, managed
regular-file effects with broker-owned reconciliation, a development-only
offline generic-worker ingress, and managed-ref promotion with a code-level
production activation gate. Provider ingress, production-qualified worker
containment, admitted check launch, bounded mandates, typed systemd D-Bus
backends, and packaged-host/Git/filesystem/power-loss qualification of
managed-pointer execution remain fail-closed release blockers; listing them
above defines the v1 target and is not a production support claim.

## Development worker ingress

The implemented worker path is deliberately narrower than the target worker
surface:

```text
root-reviewed fixed worker profile
-> durable WorkerSessionPrincipal and proposal workspace
-> exact executable launched with fixed argv under Bubblewrap
-> ephemeral-key-authenticated candidate ingress
-> agd reconstructs the reviewed target mapping and judges the candidate
-> ag-effectd compiles and persists CanonicalEffectProposalV1
-> durable terminal tombstone and process cleanup state
```

The control caller selects only a reviewed profile ID. It cannot supply an
executable, argv, target, workspace, UID/GID, epoch, or worker principal. The
launcher revalidates exact executable bytes and the launch profile, constructs
an independent proposal workspace, and binds the live principal to the
authority domain and epoch, session nonce, workspace, executable identity,
observed UID/GID, security profile, expiry, output budget, offline route, and
ephemeral ingress-key identity. The retained launch object supplies an
independent copy of the executable, workspace, UID/GID, profile, principal,
and session-spec bindings; ingress compares those facts with the reloaded
durable record instead of treating that record as its own live evidence.

The worker wire object contains candidate bytes, a closed semantic label, and
its lifecycle nonce. It has no field for a target, proposal authority,
ratification, admission, containment receipt, or canonical record. `agd`
revalidates the signed request against durable session state and maps accepted
candidate custody to the target already named by root-owned configuration.
Effectd independently checks the dynamic worker proof and continues to be the
only component that constructs canonical proposal bytes. Candidate content
occurs once on the governor-to-broker wire, inside that authenticated proof;
effectd derives the one admitted artifact from the verified content rather
than accepting a duplicate transfer supplied beside it.

Normal exit, abnormal exit, timeout, cancellation, exhausted output budget,
and startup recovery permanently fence the transient principal through a
durable tombstone. Historical inspection does not recreate it, and late output
cannot reuse it. A cleanup-complete receipt is written only after the retained
process has been synchronously reaped. Broker canonicalization, refusal, and
indeterminate outcomes are each terminal durable candidate states rather than
deferred custody. Commit-ambiguous launch or ingress storage errors fence the
running core until daemon restart and startup recovery instead of being
rewritten as semantic refusals. Provider routing is absent from this slice; no
provider secret or ambient credential enters the worker.

The catalog permits exactly one live worker. While it exists, new worker
launch and external proposal submission refuse with a busy conflict; health,
historical inspection, cancellation, and bounded polling remain available.
The worker's challenge policy is the exact configured governor enrollment
checked again by effectd, and no profile timeout may exceed its configured
clock-skew window.

This substrate is accepted only with `security_profile = "development"`.
Production and high-assurance configuration fail closed because the current
Bubblewrap launch has not earned host sandbox attestation, packaged lifecycle,
or distribution qualification. It is not the future systemd/DynamicUser
wrapper design and does not implement checks, provider-specific adapters,
multi-worker orchestration, host mandates, or systemd effects.

## Managed-pointer promotion and activation

The implemented code-promotion path closes one governed lifecycle without
giving either the worker or `agd` write access to the governed target:

```text
authenticated worker candidate Git bundle
-> agd reconstructs the reviewed effect family and target
-> ag-effectd consumes bounded preparation standing, stages the candidate,
   and proves the protected managed-ref projection unchanged
-> ag-effectd compiles and persists the canonical proposal
-> an independent human principal ratifies the exact candidate and basis in
   those broker-owned bytes
-> ag-effectd freshly re-observes that basis and constructs one-use live
   promotion standing
-> reversible preparation and a durable commit-may-proceed checkpoint
-> exact managed-ref compare-and-swap under the configured target owner
-> independent tree readback and a receipt or reconciliation requirement
```

The worker profile fixes `git_bundle_promotion_v1` and an opaque target ID.
The candidate is a strict, self-contained Git bundle v2 with one advertised
`refs/heads/ag-candidate`, no prerequisite lines, and no gitlinks. Its candidate
commit must have exactly one parent: the broker-observed commit currently named
by the managed ref. Candidate bytes remain proposal material; the worker cannot
name the destination repository or ref, construct canonical bytes, ratify the
proposal, or execute the promotion.

The pre-ratification preparation standing is target-, domain-, epoch-, catalog-,
profile-, expiry-, and budget-scoped and is not serializable. Its evidence
receipt, the full exact basis and complete-input preimage, charged quarantine
effects, and the before/after protected-projection identities are persisted as
one prepared candidate. The staging pass performs no target-object-database or
managed-ref write. Identical artifact bytes prepared against different bases
produce distinct candidate identities.

`ag-effectd` derives a proposal-scoped, single-use operation ID and binds the
activation domain and epoch, catalog and security-profile identities, expiry,
artifact and normalized pack digests, allowed root, repository and Git-directory
device/inode observations, repository identity and owner, exact ref, expected
base commit and tree, candidate commit and post-tree, staging root, and exact
Git executable and launch profile. The target is re-opened and every binding is
revalidated before mutation. Dirty, relocated, substituted, wrong-owner,
checked-out, stale-base, expired, or already-consumed targets refuse.

The ratifier is not predicted inside the pre-ratification proposal, which would
make the digest circular. The signed authorization, durable authority burn, and
one-shot attempt instead bind that exact canonical proposal to the
broker-reconstructed ratifier principal. A separate candidate-ratification
record projects the exact candidate, basis, complete inputs, and preparation
receipt from those canonical bytes. Principal-chain independence from the
proposer is checked before live promotion standing, effect preparation, or
mutation. A fresh basis mismatch is persisted as a typed eligibility refusal;
it does not burn the attempted authorization.

The closed Git adapter runs an exact retained-descriptor executable with fixed
plumbing operations, an empty and rebuilt environment, isolated Git
configuration, disabled hooks and interactive helpers, and all Git protocols
disabled. Reversible candidate validation occurs in broker-owned staging
outside the governed repository. Preparation imports and durably syncs the
exact pack as unreachable objects under the configured target UID/GID, proves
the ref is still at the exact prestate, and only then emits the checkpoint.
The commit side changes only the configured ref by compare-and-swap. Success is
issued only after the ref and resulting tree are independently observed at the
ratified poststate.

Promotion authority is burned after candidate preparation, exact ratification,
and fresh-basis standing reconstruction, but before effect preparation.
`ag-effectd` durably records that reversible effect preparation is complete
before entering the externally visible ref boundary.
A known pre-boundary failure with an exact unchanged prestate is terminal and
cannot be retried with the consumed operation. An ambiguous boundary becomes
reconciliation-required; automatic retry is forbidden. Reconciliation
independently classifies the live target as exact prestate (`not_applied`),
exact poststate (`applied`), or neither (`foreign`).

Only a verified success materializes
`ag.managed-pointer.activation-receipt/v1`. That receipt binds the exact
canonical effect, prepared candidate, candidate-specific ratification,
accepted authorization, attempt and checkpoint, predecessor and installed
object/tree, repository identity, full commit evidence, and final post-fsync
readback. The direct effectd inspection plane returns it in the strict
`ag.effect-record/v3` projection. Legacy v2 proposal records are not
reinterpreted as v3 activation custody.

Production and high-assurance authority additionally require a fresh,
non-serializable process-lifecycle activation value. Effectd reconstructs it
from the activated store (including config/profile/catalog/build identity),
current process capability and no-new-privileges state, strict effective unit
properties, the current mount namespace, pinned Git, root-owned staging
custody, and descriptor-bound repository enrollment. Applying that value is a
separate broker step: it starts from the configured exact genesis
object/tree/state identity, scans terminal managed-pointer history, advances
only through verified success receipts, requires `not_applied` reconciliation
to preserve the head, and compares the resulting head with the exact live ref.
Unresolved, foreign, or observed-applied-without-durability history blocks
readiness. The process receipt remains memory-resident explanation only;
doctor output and receipts cannot reconstruct standing after restart. A
mismatch leaves authenticated health live but not ready and refuses authority
before ratification burn.

Git children inherit only explicitly admitted descriptors after a child-local
`close_range(CLOEXEC)` floor. Managed-pointer readiness requires Landlock ABI 3
or newer. Fixed mutation children receive descriptor-rooted handled-write
sets: the quarantine stage for preparation, the exact target `objects/pack`
directory for import, and the exact Git directory for ref CAS (Git may also
transact `HEAD.lock` for a bare repository). Read-only Git inspection receives
no directory write grant. Repository command filters are refused, hooks and
helpers are intrinsically disabled, and candidate PACK stdin is reopened
read-only. This is a closed pinned-helper contract, not a general Linux claim
that Landlock mediates every metadata operation.

Version 1 manages one existing, descriptor-validated loose ref in a bare
repository or a ref that is not checked out in any attached worktree. A target
available only through `packed-refs` refuses. It deliberately refuses a
checked-out managed ref and does not update an index or working tree. There is
no hidden checkout synchronization, direct-checkout mode, generic Git command
effect, promoter daemon, provider adapter, check launcher, host mandate, or
systemd effect in this slice.

This is a code-enforced and locally tested managed-ref activation claim, not a
production deployment claim. Fresh effective-unit/process/target readiness
and the target-owner capability package contract are implemented against an
explicit checked property cut. Real package-host, expanded syscall-filter,
Git/systemd/filesystem/LSM qualification, VM execution of the packaged genesis
ceremony, the power-loss matrix, and the separate activation/upgrade ceremony
remain open release gates.

BreakGlass, direct checkout, arbitrary privileged commands, hostile
multi-tenancy, public TCP APIs, and compatibility aliases are intentionally
absent.

## Formal calculus correspondence boundary

AG-ng's reviewed formal baseline is the public Governed Admissibility Calculus
at Lean revision `ff491b808ebeab2a132d9ade46d234cf85dcfbe9`. The calculus
constrains the operational contract but is neither linked nor executed by any
daemon. Its theorems do not authenticate runtime evidence and cannot mint
authority.

`ag-kernel` contains a pure, non-authorizing adapter which binds one complete
native Rust result to the exact calculus revision, adapter schema, authority
domain, epoch, lifecycle origin, evaluator identity, and input digest. It
preserves semantic refusal and operational indeterminacy as distinct outcomes.
A stored-decision ledger can record one projection of that evidence, but it is
not an authority ledger and cannot defend a copied old store without the
system's independent epoch and restore ceremonies.

The detailed correspondence dispositions and gaps live in
`docs/formal-calculus-crosswalk.md` and
`docs/formal-calculus-obligations.json`. No daemon consumes either document.
BreakGlass remains absent despite its formal instance; exceptional runtime
authority requires a separate model, custody design, hostile review, and
operator decision.

## Implementation rule

No calculus family, abstraction, or crate is admitted unless it is consumed by
the next authority-bearing vertical slice, by an explicit non-authorizing
correspondence adapter, or by a compiled hostile specimen. A theorem-shaped
Rust API is not correspondence evidence.
